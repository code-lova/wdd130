        <p>Benin City is the capital and largest city of Edo State, Nigeria. 
            It is the fourth-largest city in Nigeria according to the 2006 census, after Lagos, Kano, and Ibadan.
            It is situated approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of the Benin River and 320 kilometres (200 mi) by road east of Lagos. 
            Benin City is the centre of Nigeria's rubber industry, and oil production is also a significant industry.
            The city was the most important settlement of the Edo Kingdom of Benin, which flourished during the 13th to the 19th century. 
            It held important trade relations with Portugal during the last centuries before being captured, sacked and burnt in 1897 by a British punitive expedition. 
            Many bronze sculptures in Benin City palace, collectively termed the Benin Bronzes, were stolen by the British who followed up 
            their victory by gradually colonizing the area, eventually incorporating the region into Colonial Nigeria.
