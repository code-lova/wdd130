                    Wetwoods Whitewater Rafting is more than pushing rubber boats down a river and making up for lost time, 
                    it is also about creating a platform for doing good in our community and having an opportunity to give back. 
                     We believe in creating lasting river memories and providing a forum for others to experience the greatness
                    of the Colorado River, the magnificence of Wetwoods Whitewater Rafting Company, along the Glenwood Springs and the 
                    Roaring Fork Valley. Our mission your experience.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Wetwoods was founded in 2020 by river pioneer Ebizo Jeremiah. 
                By 2023 the company found its permanent home in Angels Camp, California, where Jeremiah turned a 
                fledgling rafting company into what is now one of the most respected outfitting companies in the world.

                Jeremiah has been the president of Wetwoods since 2020. He is a visionary entrepreneur 
                and one of the adventure travel industry's trailblazers. But more importantly, he has built a legacy of river 
                conservation and stewardship based on the inspiring idea that spreading the love of wild rivers is the surest path 
                to their protection, now and for the enjoyment of future generations.
                They company is dedicated to furtherin the preservation of wild 
                places and creating meaningful outdoor experiences for our guests—values that have been 
                at the core of Wetwoods over 3 years.
